# Azure Terraform Modules
This repository contains the standard modules Fairwinds managed Azure implementations. The `aks_cluster` module is adaptable, and can be paired with multiple invocations of the `aks_node_pool` module. The `virtual_network` module is not specific to AKS and can be used for any Azure project that requires virtual network space.

## Usage
Please review the readme within each specific module for details on how to use them.

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Release Expectations
We intend to use semantic versioning for the modules in this repository. This means that each module folder will have a release tag similar to `module_name-v0.0.1`. We never intend any minor versions to 
recreate the AKS clusters, since this could result in state loss. If any modules are made completely incompatible, they require a major version update and we will note in release notes. If any compatibility issues are found in the wild, please submit an issue with a way to recreate the scenario.

Each module should have it's own usage documentation in the folder. The module folder should also include a `CHANGELOG.md` for that module.

We do not anticipate retrofitting patches to older MINOR versions. If we are currently on v1.2.0 and a bug is found that was introduced in v1.1.0 we will patch to v1.2.1 (and there will not be a v1.1.1). Pull requests always accepted if you have a need to patch older releases.

### Version Differences
* MAJOR: Changing versions here will require changes to your module parameters
  * Could have new **required** parameters or changes to defaults that could affect implementations
  * May remove certain parameters
  * Will not re-provision your cluster, unless noted in the changelog release notes
* MINOR: Changing minor versions should have parameter backwards compatibility
  * **Required** parameters should not change between MINOR versions
  * _Optional_ parameters may change or there may be new _optional_ parameters
  * We will **not remove _optional_ parameters** between MINOR releases, a MAJOR is required
  * Defaults on _optional_ parameters **may change** between MINOR versions, including default versions or other cluster settings
  * Change Log will outline expected differences between Minor releases
* PATCH: Changing minor defaults or logic fixes
  * Bugs that fix behavior or adjust "constant change" issues in terraform runs
  * Typos could be fixed with patch if it affects behavior of the terraform module
  * Fixes to older supported features of the module that broke with MINOR functionality changes
  * README and USAGE documentation changes may trigger a PATCH change and should be documented in CHANGELOG
